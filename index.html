              <h2>Skin Care</h2>
              <h4>Abigayle Wynsma, October 13, 2021</h4>
              <p><img src="facewash.jpeg" alt="woman washing face"></p>
              <p>It’s no surprise that taking care of yourself helps in every aspect of one’s life. However, our largest organ, skin, may be the most neglected- despite it being the outermost part of our inner beauty. It’s something I know I’ve failed to care for in the past. Nevertheless, once I realized how much better taking care of my skin made me feel, I haven’t turned back. Here is my skin care routine and what I’ve learned to hopefully help give some insight to those who don’t know where to start.</p>
              <h3>Step 1: Remove dirt or makeup, then use cleanser</h3>
                <p>I am guilty of leaving my makeup on before I went to sleep, but each time I’ve regretted it in the morning. Take some kind of makeup remover, and follow it up with a cleanser of your choice. I prefer the CeraVe Salicylic Acid wash.</p>
              <h3>Step 2: Use Toner</h3>  
                <p>One of my secret weapons I’ve used for years is taking witch hazel, or any facial astringent, and wipe off any excess dirt, makeup, etc. after cleansing. This really make sures your pores are cleaned thoroughly. </p>
              <h3>Step 3: Aloe Vera</h3>
                <p>For the past 6 years I have not missed putting aloe vera on my face. It’s natural, and kills excess bacteria laying on the skin. Be careful of which brand you use, and try your best to get a super pure aloe gel with no dye.</p>
              <h3>Step 4: Moisturize</h3>
                <p>I am always surprised at how many people skip this step! Even if you have oily skin, applying moisturizer is super important (and they make special kinds for oily skin as well!) This protects your skin from allergens and any outside debris that is harmful to your skin.</p>

              <h2> Jeff Buckley's Grace: An Album Review</h2>
              <h4>Abigayle Wynsma, October 19, 2021</h4>
              <p>The album I decided to focus on for this review is Jeff Buckley’s first and last studio album, Grace. I am not going to lie, I am a big fan of Jeff Buckley. However, I had never listened to this album all the way through before, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to listen to it in its entirety. For context, Grace came out in August of 1994 after Buckley was signed to Columbia Records. There have been many posthumous releases, but this was the only album he was actively involved in before his untimely death at 30 years old in 1997.</p>
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Date</th>
                  <th>Timeline</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1993
                    <td> Begins Recording Album</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1994</td>
                    <td> Grace is released</td>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                  <td>1997</td>
                    <td> Buckley dies in an unfortunate drowning accident</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the album. As I mentioned before, I am a fan of Jeff Buckley, but I hadn’t really listened to the second half of the album- and I am really glad I finally did. Personally, I disagree with some of the arrangements and mixing of his music as I think it can sound too busy at times, and take away from the lyrics and his vocals (where I believe his talent truly lies). I was going to write about how I also think the covers on the album were overkill (there are 3 of them), but truthfully he made them so much his own that they were unique. Funny enough, I don’t care for his cover of Hallelujah, despite that being the most popular, especially after listening fully to Grace. He wrote so many great originals, I feel that it almost discredits his capabilities as a songwriter. After learning Buckley was purely in it for the music and not for the “fame,” I respect him even more as a musician. His sincerity and love for music was demonstrated through his actions and within his music, and this is why I think Grace and Jeff Buckley’s name has stood the test of time- and even death.</p>
